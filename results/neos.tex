\chapter{NEOS}
New methods need a fair comparison to established methods in order to validate its usefulness. Therefore \ac{neos} is tested against the classical approach of training a classifier \ac{nn} with a signal and background sample. Both models are trained with the TOMATOS framework \citep{tomatos}. The trained models are then used to assign scores to selected events in the $HH\rightarrow4b$ analysis. Resulting histograms of these scores then serve to set limits on the $HH\rightarrow4b$ cross-section extracted with the \textit{cabinetry} framework \citep{cranmer_2021_4627038}. Limits also set using the invariant mass of the Higgs pair system serve as an additional baseline. For all limits the exact same methods are used to provide a fair comparison as close as possible.
