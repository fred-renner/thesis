\red{Pulls allow one to estimate how well a model fits the data. A pull is a value computed for each data bin. It is given by (observed - predicted) / standard-deviation. If the model is correct, the expectation value of each pull is zero and its variance is one in the asymptotic limit of infinite samples. Under these conditions, the chi-square statistic is computed from the sum of pulls squared has a known probability distribution if the model is correct. It therefore serves as a goodness-of-fit statistic.}
