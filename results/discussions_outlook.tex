NEOS
what actually happens if we are not applying vbf cuts? just optimized on significance.
revisit region definition with neos, chosen by intuition 
you can optimize anything 

wo einbauen? oder an welcher stelle ansetzen
einer der Vorteile von neos, weniger prone f√ºr human bias e.g. unblinding

automatically taken care of: systs don't blow up

you can optimize anything
add or remove arbitrary amount of blocks in the chain of figure 
train nn with neos and always can always go back

propose go back and make sure mc is correct

phi can also be bins and cuts

this analysis driven by stats

let neos choose cuts,
m_vbf, deta_vbf
