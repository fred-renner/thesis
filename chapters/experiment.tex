\chapter{The ATLAS Experiment at the LHC}

In particle physics scattering blah
In order to probe nature at the smallest scales scattering experiments are conducted as the De Broglie wavelength $\lambda=h/p$ tells that with increasing momentum smaller scales can be explored. At the moment the Large Hadron Colider at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) is not only the largest machine ever built, but also the most powerful particle collider at hand .


The ATLAS detector is situated in a cavern
