\chapter{Analysis Optimization}\label{sec:analysis_optimization}
\red{or should this chapter be called multivariate discriminants}

After selecting objects that represent the final state of the physical process under investigation, a metric needs to be constructed sensitive to a hypothesis test. This metric often takes the form of a kinematic variable, such as the invariant mass of the Higgs pair system $m_\text{HH}$ in this analysis, designed to differentiate between signal and background events. As elaborated in Chapter \ref{sec:statistics}, the underlying statistical test employs frequentist principles, thus  histograms derived from this metric serve as input to these tests. Throughout the development of this variable, various optimizations aim to maximize the signal-to-background ratio as a proxy for the statistical tests expressivity.

Since the purpose of this quantity is to separate signal from background it is well suited to be anaylized with a \ac{ml} model. While such models have gained widespread usage in particle physics \citep{albertsson2019machine,shlomi2020graph,feickert2021living,Schwartz2021Modern}, their effectiveness is limited when they are only optimized for signal-to-background discrimination. This is because their training doesn't usually consider broader goals like assessing discovery significance or establishing confidence levels.

The signal-to-background ratio or the efficacy of a \ac{ml} model in separating events correlates to some extent with the performance of the statistical test, however it remains suboptimal. This is because usually uncertainties are not considered at the stage of training of the \ac{ml} model which can substantially affect the outcome of hypothesis tests.

To tackle these issues \textit{\ac{neos}} \citep{Simpson_2023} provides a promising solution. This approach incorporates the statistical model and its uncertainties into the \ac{ml} model's training process, aligning it more closely with the primary goals of determining whether a new process exists. This chapter provides a brief introduction to machine learning and explains the \textit{\ac{neos}} approach in detail.

\section{Machine Learning}
\ac{ml} refers to algorithms that enable computers to learn from data to make predictions for some specific task without being explicitly programmed for \citep{kubat2021introduction}. One particular subset of \ac{ml} are \acp{ann} inspired by the human brain. Their fundamental unit are nodes, the neurons, that are interconnected to several other neurons organized in consecutive layers with an initial input and a desired output as shown in figure \ref{fig:ann}. The signals between neurons are transferred weighted and each neuron has an activation function that converts the received input stimulus into an output strength. Thus learning occurs through adjusting the weights between the neurons. \acp{ann} can be designed in various ways with many layers depending on the specific task.

    \label{fig:ann}
\end{figure}

The training of \acp{nn} is usually done with the back-propagation algorithm which seeks to minimize a cost function $C(\bm{\varphi})$ that is designed to measure the deviance of a presented input to a desired output dependent on the model parameters $\bm{\varphi}$. For a feed-forward \ac{nn} these model parameters are the mentioned weights and added biases of the neurons. Via gradient descent the minimum of the cost function can be found stepwise with the first derivative and a chosen learning rate parameter $\gamma$
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\varphi}_{n+1} = \bm{\varphi}_n-\gamma\nabla C(\bm{\varphi}_n).
    \label{eq:grad_descent}
\end{equation}
In three dimensions this corresponds to a mountaineer searching for the valley by going in the direction of the steepest descent with a stepsize proportional to $\gamma$.



\section{NEOS}
The key idea of \acl{neos} is to choose the cost function as the quantity which is to be minimized. In this case the $\mathrm{CL}_s$ value is a reasonable choice as discussed in chapter \ref{sec:statistics}. For a typical analysis chain as shown in figure \ref{fig:neos} this translates into a mathematical concatenation of the individual steps within the chain.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{neos}
    \caption[]{Typical particle physics analysis chain. For \ac{neos} the $\text{CL}_s$ value is back-propagated to train the neural network parameters $\bm{\varphi}$. Adopted from \citep{Simpson_2023}.}
    \label{fig:neos}
\end{figure}
Hence the cost function $\text{CL}_s$ is a function of the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ and the \ac{ml} model parameters $\bm{\varphi}$
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{CL}_s = f(\mathcal{D},\bm{\varphi}) = (f_{\mathrm{sensitivity}} \circ f_{\mathrm{test\,stat}} \circ f_{\mathrm{likelihood}}  \circ f_{\mathrm{histogram}}  \circ f_{\mathrm{observable}})(\mathcal{D},\bm{\varphi}).
\end{equation}
In order to find the minimum via the gradient descent of equation \ref{eq:grad_descent} \cls needs to be differentiable with respect to $\bm{\varphi}$. By applying the chain rule this reads for one model parameter $\varphi_i$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\,\mathrm{CL}_s}{\partial \varphi_i} = \frac{\partial f_{\mathrm{sensitivity}}}{\partial f_{\mathrm{test\,stat}}}\frac{\partial f_{\mathrm{test\,stat}}}{\partial f_{ \mathrm{likelihood}}} \frac{\partial f_{\mathrm{likelihood}}}{\partial f_{\mathrm{histogram}}}   \frac{\partial f_{\mathrm{histogram}}}{\partial f_{\mathrm{observable}}}  \frac{\partial f_{\mathrm{observable}}}{\partial \varphi_i}.
\end{equation}
Apart from histogramming which is inherently discrete all other steps are differentiable. A method to render histograms differentiable is \ac{kde} \citep{CRANMER2001198}. Instead of counting a quantity in bins, a histogram can be approximated by representing each data point by a normal distribution termed the kernel. This distribution has the mean equal to the the data point's value and a chosen value for the standard deviation, also called the bandwidth in this context. Since the area under each Gaussian is equal to one, the collective addition of all Gaussian's yields a smoothed estimate of a histogram that is inherently differentiable. However, it is crucial to select the bandwidth appropriately, ideally around the desired bin width, as the quality of the KDE estimate is highly sensitive to this choice. This is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:relaxed_hist}. Although this can be a source of uncertainty any differentiable step or block in figure \ref{fig:neos} can always be reverted back to the exact calculation.

Further shown is the standard histogram binned from data, the \ac{kde} and the \ac{bkde} as a histogram calculated from the area under the \ac{kde} in a chosen bin range.

\subsection{Implementation}
Tracing differentiation through software is achievable by recognizing that any software essentially comprises a series of elementary arithmetic operations. Since the analytic solutions for these operations are known, the task reduces to concatenating all these operations and differentiating the resulting function. This is also known as \textit{Automatic Differentiation} and is achieved here with the help of the software package \textsc{jax} \citep{jax2018github}.

While the concept may appear straightforward, one of the challenges that previously hindered its implementation is the difficulty of differentiating across multiple individual software frameworks.That this became feasible within a reasonable time frame builds greatly on the transition efforts  of the individual steps to the \textsc{Python} programming language, moving away from C++ \textsc{ROOT}-based software \citep{ANTCHEVA20092499}. While \textsc{root} was indispensable at its time of emergence it is now less optimal for contemporary scientific analysis. This is because it is not only more difficult to integrate within other current software but also due to its user-unfriendliness compared to \textsc{Python} solutions which are maintained by a broad scientific community doing data-analysis. Using \textsc{python} in this context presents a notable advantage since it benefits from widespread community support and pre-existing solutions to many common problems, enabling the use of tools like \textsc{jax}, which were not originally connected to \ac{hep}.


The original proposers \citet{Simpson_2023} of \ac{neos} developed differentiable versions of common \ac{hep} tasks like the upper mentioned hypothesis test, histogramming and the optimization of a cut in a packaged called \textsc{relaxed} \citep{Simpson_relaxed_version_0_3_0_2023}. They successfully tested the entire pipeline in a toy model \citep{Simpson_neos_version_0_2_0_2021}. These efforts were transferred and further developed to be applicable to this analysis with \citep{hh_neos}.
