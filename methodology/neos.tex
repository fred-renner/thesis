\chapter{Analysis Optimization}\label{sec:analysis_optimization}
\red{or should this chapter be called multivariate discriminants}

After selecting objects that represent the final state of the physical process under investigation, a metric needs to be constructed sensitive to the result of a hypothesis test which assesses the realization of this process in nature. Often, this metric takes the form of a kinematic variable, such as the invariant mass of the Higgs pair system $m_\text{HH}$ in this analysis, designed to differentiate between signal and background events. As elaborated in Chapter \ref{sec:statistics}, the underlying statistical test employs frequentist principles, thus histograms derived from this metric serve as inputs to these tests. Throughout the development of this variable, various optimizations typically aim to maximize the signal-to-background ratio as a proxy for the statistical tests expressivity.

Since the purpose of this quantity is to separate signal from background it is well suited to be anaylized with a \ac{ml} model. While such models have gained widespread usage in particle physics \citep{albertsson2019machine,shlomi2020graph,feickert2021living,Schwartz2021Modern}, their effectiveness is limited when they are only optimized for signal-to-background discrimination. This is because their training does not usually consider broader goals like assessing discovery significance or establishing confidence levels.

The signal-to-background ratio or the efficacy of a \ac{ml} model in separating events correlates to some extent with the performance of the statistical test.  However, this relationship often remains suboptimal because uncertainties, which can significantly influence the outcome of hypothesis tests, are not typically considered during the training phase of \ac{ml} models.

To address these challenges, \textit{\ac{neos}} \citep{Simpson_2023} offers a promising solution. This approach incorporates the statistical model and its uncertainties into the \ac{ml} model's training process, aligning it more closely with the primary goal of determining whether a new process exists. This chapter provides a brief introduction to machine learning and explains the \textit{\ac{neos}} approach and its application in this analysis in detail.

\section{Machine Learning}
\ac{ml} refers to algorithms that enable computers to learn from data to make predictions for some specific task without being explicitly programmed for \citep{kubat2021introduction}. One particular subset of \ac{ml} models are \acp{ann} inspired by the human brain. Their fundamental unit are nodes, the neurons, that are interconnected to other neurons. If they organized in consecutive layers with an initial input and a desired output as shown in figure \ref{fig:ann} they are referred to deep feed-forward \ac{nn}. The signals between neurons are transferred weighted and each neuron has an activation function that converts the received input stimulus into an output strength. Thus learning occurs through adjusting the weights between the neurons. \acp{ann} can be designed in various ways with many layers depending on the specific task.
\begin{figure}

    \caption[]{Structure of artificial feed-forward neural networks. Adopted from \citep{8114708}.}
    \label{fig:ann}
\end{figure}

The training of \acp{nn} is usually performed with the back-propagation algorithm which seeks to minimize a cost function $C(\bm{\varphi})$. This function measures the deviation of a presented input to a desired output dependent on the model parameters $\bm{\varphi}$. In deep a feed-forward \ac{nn} these model parameters are the mentioned weights and a bias term added to sum of the input weights per neuron. The minimum of this cost function can be found stepwise via gradient descent. Here, the update to the model parameters is guided by the negative of the gradient of the cost function, scaled by a learning rate $\gamma$
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\varphi}_{n+1} = \bm{\varphi}_n-\gamma\nabla C(\bm{\varphi}_n),
    \label{eq:grad_descent}
\end{equation}
such that moving against the gradient a monotonic decreasing series is formed $C(\bm{\varphi}_n )\ge C(\bm{\varphi}_{n+1})$ converging to a minimum of $C(\bm{\varphi})$. In three dimensions this is analogues to a mountaineer searching for the valley by going in the direction of the steepest descent with a stepsize proportional to $\gamma$.

\section{NEOS}
The central concept of \textit{\acl{neos}} involves employing a cost function that directly trains the \ac{ml} model with respect to the target quantity of interest. Insteaad of traditional classifier cost function that focuses only on differentiating between signal and background, the $\mathrm{CL}s$ value, detailed in Chapter \ref{sec:statistics}, is adopted as the quantity for minimization. For a typical analysis chain as shown in figure \ref{fig:neos} this translates into a mathematical concatenation of the individual steps within the chain.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{neos}
    \caption[]{Typical particle physics analysis chain. For \ac{neos} the $\text{CL}_s$ value is back-propagated to train the neural network parameters $\bm{\varphi}$. Adopted from \citep{Simpson_2023}.}
    \label{fig:neos}
\end{figure}
Hence the cost function $\text{CL}_s$ is a function of the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ and the \ac{ml} model parameters $\bm{\varphi}$
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{CL}_s = f(\mathcal{D},\bm{\varphi}) = (f_{\mathrm{sensitivity}} \circ f_{\mathrm{test\,stat}} \circ f_{\mathrm{likelihood}}  \circ f_{\mathrm{histogram}}  \circ f_{\mathrm{observable}})(\mathcal{D},\bm{\varphi}).
\end{equation}
In order to find the minimum via the gradient descent of equation \ref{eq:grad_descent} \cls needs to be differentiable with respect to $\bm{\varphi}$. By applying the chain rule this reads for one model parameter $\varphi_i$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial\,\mathrm{CL}_s}{\partial \varphi_i} = \frac{\partial f_{\mathrm{sensitivity}}}{\partial f_{\mathrm{test\,stat}}}\frac{\partial f_{\mathrm{test\,stat}}}{\partial f_{ \mathrm{likelihood}}} \frac{\partial f_{\mathrm{likelihood}}}{\partial f_{\mathrm{histogram}}}   \frac{\partial f_{\mathrm{histogram}}}{\partial f_{\mathrm{observable}}}  \frac{\partial f_{\mathrm{observable}}}{\partial \varphi_i}.
\end{equation}
While all steps except histogramming are inherently differentiable, histogramming can be made differentiable through the application of \ac{kde}, as described by \citep{CRANMER2001198}. This technique involves approximating histograms by treating each data point as a normal distribution (kernel) centered at the data point value, with a bandwidth corresponding to the desired standard deviation. Since the area under each Gaussian is equal to one, the collective addition of all Gaussian's yields a smoothed estimate of a histogram that is inherently differentiable. However, it is crucial to select the bandwidth appropriately, ideally around the desired bin width, as the quality of the KDE estimate is sensitive to this choice. This is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:relaxed_hist}. Although this can be a source of uncertainty any differentiable step or block in figure \ref{fig:neos} can always be reverted and calculated exactly with the parameters found by the optimization.

Further shown is the standard histogram binned from data, the \ac{kde} and the \ac{bkde} as a histogram calculated from the area under the \ac{kde} for some binning.

\subsection{Implementation}
Tracing differentiation through software is achievable by recognizing that any software essentially comprises a series of elementary arithmetic operations. Since the analytic solutions for these operations are known, the task reduces to concatenating all these operations and differentiating the resulting function. This is also known as \textit{Automatic Differentiation} and is achieved here with the help of the software package \textsc{jax} \citep{jax2018github}.

While the concept may appear straightforward, one of the challenges that previously hindered its implementation is the difficulty of differentiating across multiple individual software frameworks. That this became feasible within a reasonable time frame builds greatly on the transition efforts  of the individual steps to the \textsc{Python} programming language, moving away from C++ \textsc{ROOT}-based software \citep{ANTCHEVA20092499}. While \textsc{root} was indispensable at its time of emergence it is now less optimal for contemporary scientific analysis. This is because \textsc{Python} is much more user friendly and solutions are maintained by a broad scientific community doing data-analysis. This presents in this context a notable advantage since it benefits from pre-existing solutions to many common problems, enabling the use of tools like \textsc{jax}, which are not originally connected to \ac{hep}.

The original proposers \citet{Simpson_2023} of \ac{neos} developed differentiable versions of common \ac{hep} tasks like the upper mentioned hypothesis test, histogramming and the optimization of a cut in a packaged called \textsc{relaxed} \citep{Simpson_relaxed_version_0_3_0_2023}. They successfully tested the entire pipeline in a toy model \citep{Simpson_neos_version_0_2_0_2021}. For this thesis these efforts were further developed within a framework called TOMATOS - auTOMATed Optimization of Sensitivity \citep{tomatos}.



\section{Training}
In order to build the statistical model each histogram entering it needs to be created during training. This requires a full dataset per sample (signal, background estimate, some systematic, etc.) being processed through the whole pipeline as of figure \ref{fig:neos}.

\acp{nn} tend to learn from more frequently observed data. Thus to make use of all available data and to avoid a training class imbalance each sample is upscaled by replicating values to the sample with the largest event content, which in this case is a sample with the systematic: `JET EtaIntercalibration NonClosure PreRec up' as result of a slightly increased selection efficiency if $\eta$ is varied upwards. This needs to be accounted with a scale-factor $n_\text{sample}/n_\text{max}$ in the weights to not artificially change the counting in the histograms.

Table \ref{tab:neos-samples} gives an overview of used samples and the number of events they contain. They are chosen from an impact ranking on a \mhh fit as of fig. \red{fig reference}. The table also reveals that the background estimate is upscaled by a factor of $\sim 2$. Input variables per sample are shown in figure \ref{fig:tomats_inputs_0} and \ref{fig:tomats_inputs_1}. To ensure a fair training between features and to not let features with large values dominate the learning process a min-max scaling is applied to the inputs
\begin{equation}
    x'=\frac{x - \text{min}(x)}{\text{max}(x)-\text{min}(x)},
\end{equation}
scaling them between 0 and 1. \qty[]{90}{\percent} of events in the dataset are used for training (39713 events), whereas the other \qty[]{10}{\percent} are again split into a \qty[]{80}{\percent} validation sample (3530 events) and \qty[]{20}{\percent} test sample (883 events). In addition four samples are processed through the pipeline to estimate the background with the ABCD method described in \ref{sec:abcd}. The transfer factor and its uncertainty is estimated from the \ac{cr} and a shape uncertainty is estimated in the \ac{vr}. Event numbers are also shown in table \ref{tab:neos-samples}. Per training epoch, which corresponds to a full processing of the dataset, data are reshuffled.

The optimization also optimizes cuts on the invariant mass $m_{jj}$ and the pseudorapidity difference $|\Delta\eta(j,j)|$ of the two \ac{vbf} jets as mentioned in \ref{sec:hh4b_analysis_strategy}. Cutting on a value can be viewed mathematically by multiplying the to be cutted value with a Heaviside function that is shifted by the cut value. As differentiable approximation a sigmoid function is used which is then multiplied to the event weights.

Only uncertainties that impact the fit are used to speed up the training process. Uncertainties are are detailed in chapter \ref{sec:systematics}. The uncertainties used in the optimization comprise the 4 $b$-quark branching ratio normalization, the statistical error on the ABCD method transfer factor extraction and the shape uncertainty associated to this method, the four estimated $p_T$ binned uncertainties of the GN2X tagger, the envelope of the scale variations, the statistical errors on the \ktwov signal sample and the background estimate and two $\eta$ small-$R$ jet uncertainties.
