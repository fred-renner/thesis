  abstract   = {The response of the ATLAS detector to large-radius jets is measured in situ using 36.2 fb{\$}{\$}\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$} of {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}sqrt{\{}s{\}}=13{\$}{\$} TeV proton--proton collisions provided by the LHC and recorded by the ATLAS experiment during 2015 and 2016. The jet energy scale is measured in events where the jet recoils against a reference object, which can be either a calibrated photon, a reconstructed Z boson, or a system of well-measured small-radius jets. The jet energy resolution and a calibration of forward jets are derived using dijet balance measurements. The jet mass response is measured with two methods: using mass peaks formed by W bosons and top quarks with large transverse momenta and by comparing the jet mass measured using the energy deposited in the calorimeter with that using the momenta of charged-particle tracks. The transverse momentum and mass responses in simulations are found to be about 2--3{\%} higher than in data. This difference is adjusted for with a correction factor. The results of the different methods are combined to yield a calibration over a large range of transverse momenta {\$}{\$}{\{}(p{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm {\{}T{\}}{\}}){\}}{\$}{\$}. The precision of the relative jet energy scale is 1--2{\%} for {\$}{\$}200\~{}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}GeV{\}}\~{}<\~{}p{\_}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm {\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}}\~{}<\~{}2\~{}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}TeV{\}}{\$}{\$}, while that of the mass scale is 2--10{\%}. The ratio of the energy resolutions in data and simulation is measured to a precision of 10--15{\%} over the same {\$}{\$}p{\_}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm {\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}range.},
