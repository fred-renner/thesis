  abstract   = {The response of the ATLAS detector to large-radius jets is measured in situ using 36.2 fb{\$}{\$}\^{}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$} of {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}sqrt{\{}s{\}}=13{\$}{\$} TeV proton--proton collisions provided by the LHC and recorded by the ATLAS experiment during 2015 and 2016. The jet energy scale is measured in events where the jet recoils against a reference object, which can be either a calibrated photon, a reconstructed Z boson, or a system of well-measured small-radius jets. The jet energy resolution and a calibration of forward jets are derived using dijet balance measurements. The jet mass response is measured with two methods: using mass peaks formed by W bosons and top quarks with large transverse momenta and by comparing the jet mass measured using the energy deposited in the calorimeter with that using the momenta of charged-particle tracks. The transverse momentum and mass responses in simulations are found to be about 2--3{\%} higher than in data. This difference is adjusted for with a correction factor. The results of the different methods are combined to yield a calibration over a large range of transverse momenta {\$}{\$}{\{}(p{\_}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm {\{}T{\}}{\}}){\}}{\$}{\$}. The precision of the relative jet energy scale is 1--2{\%} for {\$}{\$}200\~{}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}GeV{\}}\~{}<\~{}p{\_}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm {\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}}\~{}<\~{}2\~{}{$\backslash$}hbox {\{}TeV{\}}{\$}{\$}, while that of the mass scale is 2--10{\%}. The ratio of the energy resolutions in data and simulation is measured to a precision of 10--15{\%} over the same {\$}{\$}p{\_}{\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathrm {\{}T{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}range.},

In the first section, after a brief discussion on parametric and non-parametric methods, the theory of kernel estimation is developed for univariate and multivariate settings. The second section discusses some of the applications of kernel estimation to high-energy physics. The third section provides an overview of the available univariate and multivariate packages. This paper concludes with a discussion of the inherent advantages of kernel estimation techniques and systematic errors associated with the estimation of parent distributions.},

The emergence of deep learning in 2012 allowed for machine learning tools which could adeptly handle higher-dimensional and more complex problems than previously feasible. This review is aimed at the reader who is familiar with high-energy physics but not machine learning. The connections between machine learning and high-energy physics data analysis are explored, followed by an introduction to the core concepts of neural networks, examples of the key results demonstrating the power of deep learning for analysis of LHC data, and discussion of future prospects and concerns. },

@article{GOUZEVITCH2020100039,
  abstract   = {In 2012 the ATLAS and CMS collaborations discovered at the LHC the Higgs boson decaying to vector bosons. This discovery has provided a strong indication that the mechanism of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) is similar to the one predicted by Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) nearly 50 years before. Since then, one of the priorities of the LHC program, as well as of the majority of the future collider proposals, is to measure directly the parameters of the EWSB potential. The goal is to identify if it has indeed the straightforward quartic shape predicted by BEH or it is more complex, as the result of an unexplored physics nature. The answer to this major scientific question will have a considerable impact on our understanding of vacuum properties and the history of the universe through the EWSB during the Big Bang. The only direct way to probe these couplings is through the measure of the production of multiple Higgs bosons, two being the simplest case. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the current searches and the state of the art insights on the topic. In particular, we explain why this ambitious project is even more challenging than the discovery of the Higgs boson itself. Finally, we sketch the plans of the HEP community for how to access the parameters of the BEH mechanism. This review is adapted to a curious reader familiar with particle physics in general or a scientist who wants to have a landscape overview of the topic.},

We pay particular attention to methods for analyzing the electroweak phase transition and calculating CP-violating asymmetries, the development of Standard Model extensions that may provide the necessary ingredients for EWBG, and searches for corresponding signatures at the high energy, intensity and cosmological frontiers.}
