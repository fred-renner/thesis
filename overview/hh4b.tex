\chapter{The HH$\rightarrow$4b analysis}

Investigating the exact shape of the Higgs potential is an interesting endeavor, as it is directly related to \ac{ewsb} and fundamental questions about the nature of the universe, as discussed in section \ref{sec:beyond_sm}. The main Higgs production modes at the \ac{lhc} are shown in Figure \ref{fig:main_production_processes} and can be understood by the fact that the Higgs boson interacts with fermions via Yukawa couplings from equation \ref{eq:yukawa_term}. Since Yukawa couplings are directly proportional to the fermion masses the Higgs boson predominantly couples to heavier particles like the top quark or the massive vector bosons. All couplings are scaled relative to their \ac{sm} values and are denoted as $\kappa_\mathrm{c} = c/c_\mathrm{sm}$. A $\kappa_\mathrm{c}$ value of 1 therforee corresponds to the \ac{sm} value for some given coupling $c$.

The first two \ac{ggf} diagrams \ref{fig:main_production_processes}(a) and \ref{fig:main_production_processes}(b) have a cross-section of $\sigma_\text{vbf HH}^\text{SM}=\qty[]{31.05}{fb}$ calculated at a center of mass energy of \qty[]{13}{TeV} at \ac{nnlo} \citep{Grazzini_2018} while the \ac{vbf} processes (c), (d) and (e) of figure \ref{fig:main_production_processes} have a production cross-section of
$\sigma_\text{vbf HH}^\text{SM}=\qty[]{1.73}{fb}$ at \ac{nnnlo} \citep{PhysRevD.98.114016}. A characteristic of the \ac{vbf} processes is that the Higgs pair products are accompanied by two additional quarks. The \ac{vbf} cross section is about \qty[]{3e4}{} times smaller than the production cross section for single Higgs $\sigma_\text{H}^\text{SM}=\qty[]{48.58}{pb}$ at the \ac{lhc} \citep{de2016arxiv} and underlines the challenge of discovering Higgs pairs in these final states.

\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:branching_fraction_hh} highlights that an interesting channel in the study of Higgs pair production is the final state with the largest branching fraction, which consists of four $b$ quarks and amounts to about \qty[]{34}{\percent}. This fully hadronic final state, however, presents the challenge of significant \ac{qcd} backgrounds.

This work focuses on the boosted topology of highly energetic jets which do not allow reconstruction of $b$-jets individually but rather of final states consisting of large-$R$ jets encapsulating two collimated $b$-jets inside. This approach substantially reduces \ac{qcd} backgrounds, as highly energetic jets are more likely to originate from heavy particles like $b$ quarks. Additionally, events with jets of large \pt are easier to trigger on. While representing a comparatively clean signal, such events are rare and thus have limited statistical power. Despite other decay signatures being more suitable for the discovery of the Higgs pair production process the power of this selection lies in proving the existence of the \ktwov coupling shown in figure \ref{fig:main_production_processes}(d) to which it is directly sensitive.

The low cross-section for this process is due to the fact that diagrams (d) and (e) in Figure \ref{fig:main_production_processes} exhibit destructive interference for \ac{sm} values. Conversely, when $\ktwov$ deviates from \ac{sm} values, the production cross-section increases significantly, with $\sigma_{\ktwov=0}\approx 20\sigma_{\ktwov=1}$ and the decay products exhibit much larger transverse momentum, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:kappa_2v_variations_mhh}.

\section{Data and Monte Carlo Simulation}
This analysis uses the full run 2 data taken by \ac{atlas} between 2015 and 2018. The dataset contains \qty[]{140.1}{fb^{-1}} of data good for physics at a center of mass energy of \qty[]{13}{TeV} \citep{DAPR-2021-01}.

\ac{mc} generation in \ac{atlas} is done in three steps. At first at parton level events are generated with \textsc{MadGraph} (v.2.7.3p3.atlas6) \citep{alwall2014automated}. The output of \textsc{MadGraph} are stochastically sampled four vectors of the final states of the process of interest.

In a second step the hadronization process is simulated with \textsc{Pythia8} \citep{Sjostrand:2014zea}. For this the \textsc{NNPDF3.0nlo} \ac{pdf} is used. The \ac{sm} \ac{vbf} cross-section is calculated to correspond to the 4b branching ratio by multiplying it with $\mathcal{B}(4b)=0.3392$.

\section{Analysis strategy}
This section describes the event selection and analysis strategy. A detailed description of reconstructed physical objects used is described in chapter \ref{ch:reco}.

\subsection{Trigger}
As outlined in section \ref{sec:tdaq} events need to be preselected. The \ac{hlt} applied in this analysis selects events with a large transverse energy $E_\text{T}$ large-$R$ jet. The definition slightly changed over the data taking years as can be seen in table \ref{tab:trigger}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Trigger selections per data taking year and minimum requirements on transverse energy $E_\text{T}$ and mass $m$ on the large R jet. }
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
        \hline
        Year & $E_\text{T}$ & $m$   \\ \hline
        2015 & $>360$       & 0     \\
        2016 & $>420$       & 0     \\
        2017 & $>420$       & $>35$ \\
        2018 & $>420$       & $>40$ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:trigger}
\end{table}
Previous studies have shown that they become fully efficient at about $\pt>\qty[]{420}{GeV}$ \citep{ATL-COM-PHYS-2020-083,ATL-COM-PHYS-2023-033}.
% Figure \ref{fig:trigger_eff} depicts the efficiencies for the different triggers that become fully efficient at about $\pt>\qty[]{420}{GeV}$.

\subsection{Large Radius Jets}
To fully capture the boosted Higgs pair topology two large $R=1.0$ jets clustered with the Anti-$k_t$ algorithm from \acp{tcc} are used as described in section \ref{sec:jets}. These enclose the two boosted collimated $b$-jets in each of them to form the Higgs candidates. If there are several large-$R$ jets the two with the highest \pt are chosen. To be fully efficient on the trigger the leading large-$R$ jet is required to have $\pt>\qty[]{450}{GeV}$. For decay products to be inside a jet holds approximately $R\approx 2m/\pt$ with the mass $m$ and transverse momentum of the parent particle \citep{ATL-COM-PHYS-2020-083}. For a Higgs mass of \qty[]{125}{GeV} to be contained inside a large-$R$ jet the Higgs candidate therefore must have $\pt\gtrsim \qty[]{250}{GeV}$ and is thus chosen as the \pt requirement on the sub-leading Higgs candidate. If there are several large-$R$ jets the two leading \pt jets are selected. Additionally both Higgs candidates have a mass requirement $m>\qty[]{50}{GeV}$ to reduce \ac{qcd} background.
% As a minimum quality criterion large R jets are then required to have $200<p_{\text{T}}<3000$ GeV, $50<m<600$ GeV and $|\eta|<2$.
The identification of $b$-jets inside the selected large-$R$ jets is done with the $X\rightarrow bb$ tagger explained in section \ref{sec:xbb}. The top fraction $f_\text{top}$ is set to 0.25 and the \qty[]{60}{\percent} Higgs efficiency \ac{wp} is required. Studies with the more inclusive \qty[]{60}{\percent} \ac{wp} displayed slightly worse limit results \citep{ATL-COM-PHYS-2023-033}.

\subsection{Small Radius Jets}
Two small radius $R=0.4$ jets are required for the \ac{vbf} signature and are referred to as \ac{vbf} jets in the following. They are also reconstructed with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm and as \acp{pfo} as described in \ref{sec:jets}. The tight \ac{wp} for the \ac{jvt} and the LooseBad \ac{wp} for the event cleaning are applied both described in \ref{sec:calibration}. Small-$R$ jets $j$ are selected for $\pt>\qty[]{20}{GeV}$ and $|\eta|<4.5$ and are required to be outside of the Higgs candidate large-$R$ jets $J$ by imposing $\Delta R(J,j) > 1.4$. Further cuts applied on the \ac{vbf}jet system optimized on significance are $|\Delta\eta(j,j)| > 3$ and $m_{jj} > \qty{1}{TeV}$.

\subsection{Kinematic Regions}\label{sec:kinematic_regions}
\ac{sr}, Validation Region (VR) and \ac{cr} are explored and optimized in previous analyses \citep{aad2023search,ATL-COM-PHYS-2023-033} in the $m_{H1},m_{H2}$ plane and are defined as
\begin{equation}
    SR=X_{hh} =  \sqrt{\left(\frac{m_{H1} - \SI{124}{\GeV}}{1500 / m_{H1}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{m_{H2} - \SI{117}{\GeV}}{1900 / m_{H2}}\right)^{2}} < 1.6,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{VR_Xhh}
    VR =  \sqrt{\left(\frac{m_{H1} - \SI{124}{\GeV}}{0.1 \ln(m_{H1})}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{m_{H2} - \SI{117}{\GeV}}{0.1 \ln(m_{H2})}\right)^{2}} < 100,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \label{CR_Xhh}
    CR = \sqrt{\left(\frac{m_{H1} - \SI{124}{\GeV}}{0.1 \ln(m_{H1})}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{m_{H2} - \SI{117}{\GeV}}{0.1 \ln(m_{H2})}\right)^{2}} > 100  \ \& \ < 170.
\end{equation}
Figure \ref{fig:m_hh_plane} depicts the regions in the $m_{H1},m_{H2}$ plane on the \ac{sm} signal sample.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Background Estimation}\label{sec:abcd}
Since the final state of this analysis is hadronic it remains a challenging task to estimate the contributions from the plethora of \ac{qcd} processes that contribute to the background. Therefore the well established ABCD method is employed to derive a data-driven background estimate \citep{buttinger2018background,PhysRevD.103.035021}. It is based on the idea to use two independent variables e.g. $f$ and $g$ to define four orthogonal regions A, B, C and D as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:abcd} so that for some combination of the ratio of the event yields in the regions hold
\begin{equation}
    \frac{N_A}{N_B}=\frac{N_C}{N_D}.
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{abcd}
    \caption[]{Illustration of four orthogonal regions A,B,C and D defined by two variables $f$ and $g$ in the horizontal and signal and background yields in the vertical dimension. Adopted from \citep{PhysRevD.103.035021}.}
    \label{fig:abcd}
\end{figure}
By rearranging the equation for the unknown $N_A$ an estimate for the background of the signal region can be derived from the other known quantities that lie in the regions dominated by the background. This approach relies on the assumption that the shape of the background in figure \ref{fig:abcd} does not vary greatly between C to D and A to B. Therefore the method must always be tested in a different region to determine its reliability.


In this analysis the two orthogonal variables are defined via the amount of $X\rightarrow bb$ Higgs tagged large-$R$ jets denoted as Xbb and the kinematic regions of the \ac{sr} and \ac{cr} defined in \ref{sec:kinematic_regions}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Four orthogonal region definitions for the ABCD method}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        2 Xbb in CR & 2 Xbb in SR \\ \hline
        1 Xbb in CR & 1 Xbb in SR \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:abcd}
\end{table}
This gives the four orthogonal regions shown in table \ref{tab:abcd}. Hence, the background in the \ac{sr} is estimated with a weight extracted from the \ac{cr}
\begin{equation}
    N_\text{SR}^\text{2Xbb}=\frac{N_\text{CR}^\text{2Xbb}}{N_\text{CR}^\text{1Xbb}} N_\text{SR}^\text{1Xbb} = w_\text{CR} N_\text{SR}^\text{1Xbb}.
\end{equation}
